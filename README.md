# Calculator DApp

This decentralized application (DApp) provides users with a simple, on-chain calculator for basic arithmetic operations. Built using *Move* and deployed on the *Aptos blockchain, the DApp allows users to perform calculations securely, with results stored on-chain. The front-end is built using **TypeScript*.

## Features
- *Basic Arithmetic Operations*: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- *On-Chain Calculations*: All calculations are performed and stored on the Aptos blockchain.
- *Move Smart Contract*: Ensures accuracy and security of calculations.
- *Clean UI*: A user-friendly interface to input numbers and view results in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- *Move Language*: Handles the logic for arithmetic operations and ensures that results are securely recorded on-chain.
- *Aptos Blockchain*: Provides decentralized and secure storage for calculation results.
- *TypeScript*: For creating an interactive and responsive front-end.

## How It Works
1. *Input Numbers*: Users enter two numbers in the provided input fields.
2. *Select Operation*: Choose the arithmetic operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide) from the options.
3. *Submit*: Clicking the "Calculate" button will perform the operation on the Aptos blockchain.
4. *View Results*: The result is calculated and displayed on the screen, while the details are stored on-chain.

## Prerequisites
- *Aptos CLI*: Required for deploying and interacting with the smart contracts.
- *Move SDK*: Used for developing the smart contracts.
- *Node.js & npm*: For running the TypeScript front-end.
